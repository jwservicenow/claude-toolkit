# /newplan — Planning Skill

Turn an idea into an approved, written plan through structured dialogue. The deliverable is a markdown plan file saved flat in the working directory.

**Strictly user-invoked.** Only activate when the user types `/newplan`. Never auto-trigger.

## Process (follow in order)

### Step 1 — Explore Project Context

Before asking anything, read what's available in the working directory:
- README, CLAUDE.md, or any existing docs
- Existing plan files (`*-plan-*.md`)
- Any other files that seem relevant to the topic the user described

Do not look for git history or commits.

State what you found in one sentence before moving on. If nothing is relevant, say so and continue.

### Step 2 — Ask Clarifying Questions

Ask up to **4 questions**, one at a time. Stop as soon as you have enough to propose approaches — don't use all 4 for the sake of it.

- Prefer multiple-choice questions over open-ended ones
- Focus on: **the goal** (mandatory), constraints, success criteria, scope
- Pin down a single, clearly stated goal and get the user to explicitly agree to it before proposing approaches. This goal is the spine of the plan — everything else hangs off it, and it gets verified at the end.
- One question per message — wait for the answer before asking the next

### Step 3 — Propose 3–4 Approaches

Present 3–4 distinct approaches. For each:
- A short name
- What it involves (2–3 sentences)
- Key trade-offs
- Fit for this specific context

End with your recommendation and the reason. Ask the user to pick one before continuing.

### Step 4 — Write the Plan

Once the user picks an approach, write the complete plan at once using this structure:

---

# [Topic] Plan

## Goal
The single agreed goal from Step 2 — what we're trying to achieve and why. Stated once here, tracked through the steps, verified at the end.

## Approach
The chosen approach and the reasoning behind it.

## Steps
Ordered list of concrete steps to execute the plan. The **final step is always closure** — point it at the `## Closure` section below.

## Testing
How to verify it worked.

## Backout
How to undo or recover if something goes wrong.

## Risks
What could go wrong, how likely, and how bad.

## Open Assumptions
Things assumed to be true that have not been verified.

## Goal Verification
The single check that confirms the agreed goal (top of this plan) was actually achieved — not just that the steps ran. State the concrete, observable condition that proves it's done, and who confirms it.

## Closure
The last task of every plan, always present. Once the goal above is verified and the work is done:
1. Banner the plan header with **`STATUS YYYY-MM-DD — DONE.`** (today's date).
2. Move both this plan (`<topic>-plan-*.md`) and its prompt (`<topic>-prompt-*.md`) into the project's `archive/` folder.

Until these are done, this section stands as the open marker that the plan isn't closed yet.

---

### Step 5 — Self-Review (do this before showing the user anything)

Review the draft silently:

1. **TBD scan** — Any incomplete sections, vague steps, or placeholders? Fill or flag them.
2. **Contradiction check** — Do any sections conflict with each other?
3. **Assumption verification** — Which assumptions can you confirm from the context you read in Step 1? Mark those confirmed in the plan. Move anything unverified to Open Assumptions.
4. **Remaining assumptions** — Anything you assumed while writing that the user never confirmed? Add to Open Assumptions.
5. **Scope check** — Is this focused enough to execute, or does it need to be broken down?
6. **Goal trace** — Does the Goal Verification section actually test the agreed goal from Step 2, and do the Steps lead to it? If the goal drifted while writing, fix it so top and bottom match.

Fix issues inline. Then show the user the finished plan.

### Step 6 — Save the File

Save the plan to the working directory as:

```
<topic>-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

`<topic>` is a short kebab-case label (e.g. `auth-refactor-plan-2026-06-07.md`). Use today's date.

### Step 7 — Generate the Transition Prompt

Write a companion file alongside the plan:

```
<topic>-prompt-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

The transition prompt should contain:
- One sentence on the goal and chosen approach
- The first concrete step to take
- An instruction to read the full plan file before doing anything: "Full plan is in `<topic>-plan-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — read it before starting."

Then echo the full contents of the prompt file to the screen so the user can copy-paste it immediately if starting now.

Tell the user both filenames.

### Step 8 — Finish

The deliverables are the two files from Steps 6–7: the plan (`*-plan-*.md`) and the standalone transition prompt (`*-prompt-*.md`). **Do not create a README** — keep the project lean; the plan doc is the self-contained resume point and the prompt file is the paste-to-resume pointer. Leave any existing README untouched.

That's the end — no handoff, no next steps.

## Rules

- User-invoked only. Never activate automatically.
- One question at a time. Wait for each answer.
- Max 4 clarifying questions. Stop earlier if you have what you need.
- Always propose 3–4 approaches. Not fewer.
- Always self-review before showing the plan.
- This skill produces plans, not code. Never write or scaffold implementation.
- Stop at the saved doc. No handoff to other skills.
